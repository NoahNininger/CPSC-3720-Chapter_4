<!--
   This is a game between a player and the computer, where both will make a 
   random selection of either Rock, Paper, or Scissors (alternatively, you 
   could create a version using real player input!). Rock will beat out 
   Scissors, Paper will beat out Rock, and Scissors will beat out Paper. 
   You can use JavaScript to create your own version of this game, applying 
   the logic with an if statement. Since this project is a little more 
   difficult, here are some suggested steps:

      1. Create an array that contains the variables Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

      2. Set up a variable that generates a random number 0-2 for the player 
         and then do the same for the computer's selection. The number 
         represents the index values in the array of the 3 items.

      3. Create a variable to hold a response message to the user. This can 
         show the random results for the player and then also the result for 
         the computer of the matching item from the array.

      4. Create a condition to handle the player and computer selections. 
         If both are the same, this results in a tie.

      5. Use conditions to apply the game logic and return the correct results. 
         There are several ways to do this with the condition statements, but 
         you could check which player's index value is bigger and assign the 
         victory accordingly, with the exception of Rock beating Scissors.

      6. Add a new output message that shows the player selection versus the 
         computer selection and the result of the game.
